# Python-learning
Scripts, projects, and notes from my Python learning journey
This repo is mainly to track my Python learning progress as I transition from IT infrastructure into automation and cybersecurity.
I will be using coddy.tech/replit - 100 days of Python, to learn Python as well as using Notion to track my notes.
